# Foodverse

Foodverse is an Android app designed to help users with planning meals. 

# Features
## Ingredients
The user can add a list of ingredients. Each ingredient has a brief description, a best before
date, a location, an amount, a unit, and a category. The user can add ingredients to the list,
edit them, and delete them. 

## Recipes
The user can compile together their ingredients to create recipes. These recipes have a title,
a preparation time, a number of servings, a category, comments, a photo, and a list of included
ingredients. The user can add, edit, and delete recipes from their recipe list. 

## Meal Plan
The user can create a meal plan from their recipes and ingredients. From the meal planning list,
the user can add a new meal. Each meal has a date, and can consist of a recipe and a list of
additional ingredients. The added meals should then appear as a list, displaying the date and 
their recipe if it has one. 

## Shopping List
From the ingredient storage and the meal plan, the app will compile a list of ingredients that
need to be purchased.
